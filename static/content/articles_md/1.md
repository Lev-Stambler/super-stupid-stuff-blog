Ok, so quarantine slightly broke me. My college dorm room back at school was ðŸ˜Š. I could truly get some relaxing in. I would spend my Saturdays spending time with friends or just sipping tea while watching some TV show.

And even with Zoom and an endless supply of Disney Plus, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, you name it (shout out to my streaming service provider-- you know who you are), I feel like something is missing in quarantine.

*Oh yes, a peace and quite...*

One gloomy evening, I put on my inventor cap and made Shut Up Covid. A simple, yet beautiful web app which will yell shut up whenever someone is being too loud. Need the house to be entirely silent? Adjust the noise threshold and enjoy the soothing sounds of a grown man yelling **SHUT UP**.
